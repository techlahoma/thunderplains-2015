To some it might appear that our language—which already seems accessible and approachable for beginners— is becoming even more accessible and approachable. However, both the humanities and CS education research have proven that abstraction, while a powerful tool for knowledgeable practitioners, can be an equally powerful foil for beginners. As we enter the era of language-level abstractions in ES6/2015, we are charged with the task of rethinking how we teach JavaScript. Through an interdisciplinary montage I will identify the problem of teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous demand across nearly every domain, and align the issues of creativity and critical thinking in the humanities with issues in computer science. The talk will conclude with a discussion of how the discipline of computer science and that of the humanities can inform each other to produce more effective and creative solutions to both developing and teaching abstractions.</p></div><div id="williams-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Formerly a NYC Teaching Fellow, Ashley learned the ropes teaching middle school science in Harlem, NYC.

WebGL is a fairly low-level API that has a lot of power and archane complexity. Most of the knowledge-base for GL-related technologies is written towards developers of non-web technologies. I would like to boil this technology down into a simple conceptual intro of the lower-level API that is specifically targeted towards web developers. I would also like to challenge the attendees on what future applications can be built using WebGL and how it will fundamentally change how we interact with the web.</p></div><div id="tatum-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>With a background in contemporary sculpture, aquarium exhibit design, marketing, animation, and web development, Greg is all over the place.

Or a transpiler, or whatever the cool kids are calling them these days. No formal knowledge of compilers is required.<br/>In this talk, I'll show you how to use tools like Jison to build a compiler that targets JavaScript as a runtime. You can even generate Source Maps, so you can debug against your original code in the browser.<br/>We'll then put it to use by writing a compiler for the greatest programming language of all time: ArnoldC.</p></div><div id="Steele-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Matt Steele is a front-end developer living in Omaha.

While jQuery may become less relevant over time as modern browsers are more widely adopted, it is a real and present part of modern web development today. What jQuery does not provide is any built-in programmatic structure. And, applications without consistent structure can quickly become unmaintainable spaghetti code.<br/>We'll look at techniques for writing better jQuery infused code, refactoring existing jQuery code, and writing good tests.</p></div><div id="Dale-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Ken Dale (http://kendaleiv.com) is a skilled and passionate software developer with most of his current technology focus centered around the .NET web stack, JavaScript, and cloud technologies.

I'm a developer and designer originally from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In December of 2014, I graduated from the University of Notre Dame with two degrees, a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Design. During University, I learned that I had a passion for developing functional, user-friendly digital solutions to various problems. I currently am working at IBM Watson Life in Austin, Texas as a Software Engineer.<br/>While my stack of choice is Ruby on Rails with EmberJS, I pride myself on my ability to quickly learn the languages, tools, and/or frameworks best for solving a problem. When I'm not coding or designing, you can usually find me bboying, grabbing a cup of coffee at Epoch, or recording an episode for <a href="http://www.twoblacknerds.com/">my podcast</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="schedule-talk schedule-room3"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="speakers/blaine-bublitz/headshot.png" alt="Blaine Bublitz"/><h3>Maybe We Should Slow Down</h3><h4>Blaine Bublitz</h4></div><ul role="tablist" class="nav nav-tabs"><li class="nav-room1 active"><a role="tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#bublitz-talk">Talk</a></li><li class="nav-room1"><a role="tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#bublitz-bio">Bio</a></li></ul><div class="tab-content"><div id="bublitz-talk" class="tab-pane active"><p>The world of JavaScript is moving faster than ever. There's a new framework, compile-to-JS language, or tool every day. <br/>More than 156,000 packages are published on npm. We have conventions, like SemVer, that allow us to avoid some of the pitfalls of this rapid pace, but there are still questions we should ask ourselves. Does this speed produce the best code? What about the best APIs? Having been part of the gulp 4 and lodash 3 development efforts, I've found that taking time to think through your APIs before beginning development leads to better APIs and more concise code. In this talk, I plan to show the payoff to thinking through APIs before writing any code behind them with comparison to libraries that often release API breaking changes, which can cause users to have painful upgrade processes.</p></div><div id="bublitz-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Blaine is a Co-Founder of Iced Dev, a Phoenix-based JavaScript consultancy, and an avid contributor to open-source projects like lodash and gulp.
